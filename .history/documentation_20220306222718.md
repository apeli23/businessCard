## Prerequisites

Entry-level knowledge in javascript and React/Nextjs and css.

## Setting Up the Sample Project

Use `npx create-next-app carddesign` to create a Next.js project and head to the directory using `cd carddesign`

We begin with backend setup. The backend involves  intergrating [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/?ap=em) for media upload. We'll use our backend code to upload generated card templates.

Use this [link](https://cloudinary.com/console) to access the cloudinary login page. If you don't have an account you can create one and log into it to access your dashboard. The dashboard should contain environment variables necessary for cloudinary intergration. To use these variables, go to your project root folder and create a new file names `.env`. 
Paste the following code and fill the blanks with your environment variables from cloudinary dashboard.

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME =

CLOUDINARY_API_KEY =

CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
```

Use `npm run dev` command to start your project.

Head to the `pages/api` directory and create a file named `upload.js`.  cd
