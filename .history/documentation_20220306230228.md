### Design Business card with Nextjs and Emotion css

## Introduction

In this article we use emotion css to design card templates that can be used as business cards. We demonstrate the manipulation of coloring css grids to come up with a beautifull structure flexible to any developer to use for a business venture as a template. Based on preference, the colors can be changed and information grid layout merged in any posisible manner. Lets begin!

You can get the project github repo using [Github](/).

## Prerequisites

Entry-level knowledge in javascript and React/Nextjs and css.

## Setting Up the Sample Project

Use `npx create-next-app carddesign` to create a Next.js project and head to the directory using `cd carddesign`

We begin with backend setup. The backend involves  intergrating [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/?ap=em) for media upload. We'll use our backend code to upload generated card templates.

Use this [link](https://cloudinary.com/console) to access the cloudinary login page. If you don't have an account you can create one and log into it to access your dashboard. The dashboard should contain environment variables necessary for cloudinary intergration. To use these variables, go to your project root folder and create a new file names `.env`. 
Paste the following code and fill the blanks with your environment variables from cloudinary dashboard.

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME =

CLOUDINARY_API_KEY =

CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
```

Use `npm run dev` command to start your project.

Head to the `pages/api` directory and create a file named `upload.js`. Start by pasting the following inside

```
var cloudinary = require("cloudinary").v2;

cloudinary.config({
    cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_NAME,
    api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
    api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});
```
The above code configures our cloudinary environment keys and libraries.
We can finally introduce a handler function to execute our POST request.

```
export default async function handler(req, res) {
    if (req.method === "POST") {
        let url = ""
        try {
            let fileStr = req.body.data;
            const uploadedResponse = await cloudinary.uploader.upload_large(
                fileStr,
                {
                    resource_type: "video",
                    chunk_size: 6000000,
                }
            );
            url = uploadedResponse.url
        } catch (error) {
            res.status(500).json({ error: "Something wrong" });
        }

        res.status(200).json({data: url});
    }
}
```
Our handler function will receive media data from the frontend, upload it and return the file's cloudinary link as a response.

Our backend is complete. Let's now design our card.

We will design our cards using emotion css. Therefore we begin by installing the necessary modules.
```
npm install @emotion/react @emotion.styled
```

We wil be creating the necessary components and importing them where necessary.

Using css, we will create a card component and use grids to divide the component. We can then color the grids respective of what
