### Design Business card with Nextjs and Emotion css

## Introduction

In this article we use emotion css to design card templates that can be used as business cards. We demonstrate the manipulation of coloring css grids to come up with a beautifull structure flexible to any developer to use for a business venture as a template. Based on preference, the colors can be changed and information grid layout merged in any posisible manner. Lets begin!

## Codesandbox

The final demo can be viewed on [Codesandbox](/).

You can get the project github repo using [Github](/).

## Prerequisites

Entry-level knowledge in javascript and React/Nextjs and css.

## Setting Up the Sample Project

Use `npx create-next-app carddesign` to create a Next.js project and head to the directory using `cd carddesign`

We begin with backend setup. The backend involves  intergrating [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/?ap=em) for media upload. We'll use our backend code to upload generated card templates.

Use this [link](https://cloudinary.com/console) to access the cloudinary login page. If you don't have an account you can create one and log into it to access your dashboard. The dashboard should contain environment variables necessary for cloudinary intergration. To use these variables, go to your project root folder and create a new file names `.env`. 
Paste the following code and fill the blanks with your environment variables from cloudinary dashboard.

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME =

CLOUDINARY_API_KEY =

CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
```

Use `npm run dev` command to start your project.

Head to the `pages/api` directory and create a file named `upload.js`. Start by pasting the following inside

```
var cloudinary = require("cloudinary").v2;

cloudinary.config({
    cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_NAME,
    api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
    api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});
```
The above code configures our cloudinary environment keys and libraries.
We can finally introduce a handler function to execute our POST request.

```
export default async function handler(req, res) {
    if (req.method === "POST") {
        let url = ""
        try {
            let fileStr = req.body.data;
            const uploadedResponse = await cloudinary.uploader.upload_large(
                fileStr,
                {
                    resource_type: "video",
                    chunk_size: 6000000,
                }
            );
            url = uploadedResponse.url
        } catch (error) {
            res.status(500).json({ error: "Something wrong" });
        }

        res.status(200).json({data: url});
    }
}
```
Our handler function will receive media data from the frontend, upload it and return the file's cloudinary link as a response.

Our backend is complete. Let's now design our card.

We will design our cards using emotion css. Therefore we begin by installing the necessary modules.
```
npm install @emotion/react @emotion.styled
```

We wil be creating the necessary components and importing them where necessary.

Using css, we will create a card component and use grids to divide the component. We can then fill specific grids with colors respective of how colorful our card should look like. Our project will of course include several extra components like `Title` and `Forms`. The article will however focus on creating the card component.

In the `pages/index` directory , replace the contents with the following
```
export default function Home(){
    function(
        <>
            <Card1 />
        </>
    )
}
```

To create the card component in the return function we will use [forwardref](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html) which is used to automatically pass a `ref` through a component to one of its children.
start by importing `forwardRef` and `createRef` and declaring our `ref` variable.
Inside the Home function , create your card component and refference  it in the DOM element as shown
```
import { forwardRef,  createRef} from 'react';
export default function Home(){
    const Card1 = forwardRef((props, ref) => (
    <Card_1 ref={refOne} >
       
    </Card_1>
  ));
    function(
        <>
            <Card1 ref={refOne} />
        </>
    )
}
```

In your `styles` directory , create a directory named `emotion/card1.js` and inside we start by  creating a card component. Ensure to import `emotion module` before creating your component.


```
import styled from "@emotion/styled";

export const Card_1 = styled.div`
    height: 220px;
    width: 390px;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 2% 96% 2%;
    grid-template-rows: 4% 92% 4%;
    position: relative;
    margin-left: 15%;
    overflow: hidden;
    box-shadow: 2px 5px 15px 0px #17161694;
    background-color: #122529;
    &:hover {
        transform: scale(1.1);
        transition: 0.3s;
      }
`;
```

The above code creates a card component. I put a background color for it to be visible enough. Everything else shall be done inside the card container. Ensure to import it in the `index` directory for the code to run.

Below is a preview of the above 

![Card container](https://res.cloudinary.com/dogjmmett/image/upload/v1646638640/blank_card_kmn1mi.png "Card container")

We now introduce a colorgrid which we will contain our colored designs. Add the code below to the `styles/emotion/card1` directory.

```
export const ColorGrid = styled.div`
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 150px);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(8, 50px);
  grid-gap: 8px;
  width: 150px;
  height: 400px;
  transform: rotate(-45deg);
`;
```

After importing the code above in the `index ` directory, include the component inside the card component as shown below
```
export default function Home(){
    const Card1 = forwardRef((props, ref) => (
    <Card_1 ref={refOne} >
       <ColorGrid>
       </ColorGrid>
    </Card_1>
  ));
    function(
        <>
            <Card1 ref={refOne} />
        </>
    )
}
```

You can view your colorgrid though your browser inspect section. Yor colorgrid should look like below:


![Color Grid](https://res.cloudinary.com/dogjmmett/image/upload/v1646641262/colorgrid_ptl8sz.png "Color Grid")

With the colorgrid set up , we are ready to include our colors as we see fit. Th e trick is to select the specific grids and fill the background with respective colors. This article will use the color red and green for our card component. 

Head to the `emotion/card1` directory and add the following 
```
export const Black = styled.div`
  margin-left: 30%;
  background-color: #343536;
  grid-column: 2 / span 2;
  grid-row: 1 / span 3;
`;

export const Red1 = styled.div`
  background-color: #e45e4f;
  grid-row: 2 / span 5;
`;

export const Red2 = styled.div`
  background-color: #e45e4f;
  grid-column: 2 / span 2;
  grid-row: 4/7;
`;

export const Green = styled.div`
  background-color: #007e67;
  grid-column: 2/4;
  grid-row: 7/9;
`;
```

In the code above as earlier stated. we set the property `background-color`
